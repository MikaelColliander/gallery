They were about HTML, and even one post was about the then just invented language Javascript. I was about 12 or 13 and the Internet had started to gain mainstream momentum. The dot-com bubble was building up. It would burst in March 2000, and I would give up on programming long before that, I just didn't know that while writing those posts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt felt like I had to wait a million years to get computer access at home. To stand the waiting, I started collecting computer magazines, bringing the attached floppies and later CD-ROM's over to friends with computers to see what they contained. These magazines also used to provide simple guides on various topics, one of those happened to be HTML. I had to memorize the tags so that I could test them out by entering them in notepad.exe on the demo systems at my local Lap Power dealership.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was 11 when I got my hands on a screaming fast multi media monster (Pentium MMX) at home, a year later, a Telia 020 dialup connection completed the setup. It gave me everything I ever wished for. At this point, I knew very well how to abuse the \u003cmarquee\u003e HTML tag and quickly managed to set up Geocities hosting.\u003c/marquee\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Internet was very different back then. It provided me with a safe space during my years in secondary school. I even OP'd a successful channel on DALnet during those years. I never really got the hang of how the Perl scripts on Matt's Script Archive worked or what Dim meant in Visual Basic. I wanted to, but my interest had already started to shift to movie making.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn my later teens, I tried my best preparing for a career in film making. It proved to be difficult, being based in a small town far away from the industry didn't exactly help. To me, it made little sense to move just to Stockholm. If relocation was going to be required, why not move even further away. That's how I ended up in the Netherlands and how I began my exploration of north-west Europe. Brussels, Belgium was to follow, and before finally ending up in Stockholm, I spent ten years in Hamburg, Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think it was in the Netherlands that I got my first VPS, I was a bit afraid at first, as it didn't come with a full-blown desktop environment that I had come to expect from my time using Red Hat Linux 5.2 (not REHL, much older). I slowly started to figure out how the command line worked, and with time people would actually pay me to do system administration for them. One thing bothered me, though, while I was confident in configure and run applications, I could still not fully understand how something was working by reading its source code.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter doing Sysadmin, I developed a passion for programming. I remember, for years, all I did was study programming. I lived and breathed programming. I didn't even follow the news during these years, it's as if they didn't exist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI now work as a Devops, making good use of the experiences that led me to this position.\u003c/p\u003e    ",

As a schoolboy, I read all the books in my local library about the technical details of steam engines, airplanes, rockets, robots, and more. When I was in 6th grade, I discovered a missing component. It was a computer. I immediately realized how valuable computers can be in my passion for invention. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI decided to learn as much as possible about computers and programming.Thanks to my parents, they very soon noticed my craving for computers. They bought me a 48K ZX Spectrum, then an i486, then a Celeron. I started learning programming with Basic, Asm, Pascal, then switched to C/C++. I spent nights disassembling and reverse engineering applications and video games in attempt to figure out how they were made.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTime has passed, I still have the same kid-ish curiosity and the same desire to explore and learn new things and make something special.These are still my main driving forces. When I find something attractive, I lose track of time digging into it down to its roots.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the beginning of my IT career, I was a game developer. I have dealt with all aspects of the game development industry such as graphics design, sound design, level design, game features design, and of course programming, scripting, and testing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have learned a lot and got an unforgettable experience working for 8 years in the game industry.In 2009, I decided to shift the focus of my career to software development, I was looking for something related to the Internet.Then I discovered an endless ocean of different technology stacks and approaches in web application development.Now I am a full-stack developer. I prefer to work on the server-side. I can work with .NET and NodeJS stack. In terms of frontend development, I have experience writing applications using React and pure JavaScript. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI would like to advance my knowledge and skills towards system design, microservices, cloud solutions, high loads, and especially in the direction of web application security.I am eager to master new tools and technologies and apply them in practice. I firmly believe if one wants to be competitive, they need to constantly learn.I find pleasure in preventing and solving complex problems. I love the feeling when I see the results of work done that are useful for people or companies. When a new version that you have been developing for long time goes live and it works as expected, this brings unforgettable satisfaction with what has been done.I really appreciate the opportunity to be a member of the leet family at Tretton37.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e I look forward to expanding and applying my experience, as well as my ambitions and potential, to help companies meet their business needs. I am delighted to meet and work with all these talented creative people, who share the same mindset as me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI like spending my spare time with my family and friends. When I need to unload my brain and temporarily get rid of the thought of projects and work, I prefer to re-energize in nature. Traveling, hiking, cycling, and sailing help me quite well. I like many different outdoor and indoor activities. I am always open to trying something new. I like playing board games as well as video games. I play chess.\u003c/p\u003e   ",

It's not only about creating software though, it enables me to create good communication among the team, it's amazing when you communicate, brainstorm, learn, teach, solve, and as a bonus, you even get paid for it! It challenges me a lot that every day I happily need to learn a new thing. It can be a skill, a technology, even a soft skill, or the way that you need to think about a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I'm not at work, I'm either spending time with my family or learning something new.\u003c/p\u003e   ",

I have always been a bit of a master of deviation, always taking the \"wrong\" turn. I went off to study about book bindings, package design and print. That's where I got a sense about what function design actually is, and what it takes to make it an experience of pure craftsmanship. I noticed a lack of computer knowledge during my studies, so I continued to explore computers on my own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis helped me to achieve something that I had in my mind both faster and easier.

Being aware that the simplest solution can be produced from a complex process, I try to consult with experts, explore all the possible options and take the time - and patience - with the product to design the best solution and never be a solo player. I believe problem solving with design thinking is a great tool we invented in 20th century. I also love the unknown, so I am always on a quest for knowledge and am prepared to share both my mistakes and good examples.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy free time consists of family time, sport, friends, and multiple hobbies.

My parents used to punish me for things I did or did't do by taking my power supply cable and I was convinced I was the smartest person in the world when I secretly bought another one and hid it under my bed to be used whenever I was being punished.

Some of the best moments for me are when you have a real challenge with the task in hand and then when you finally crack it, you almost shout out loud! I also like it when you find a piece of code that you think is really well written, and you start to wonder about who wrote it. So, you check the source control to see who created this masterpiece, only to find out that it was actually you, yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI love to travel and dance to good music out in nature, so I usually end up spending most of my vacation travelling to festivals all over the world.

Our team consisted of people from all over Sweden, and even other countries. In retrospect I realise that, as young teenagers we were working on projects together in self-organising distributed teams. We were using the ways of remote communication available at the time, which was the telephone, letters with floppies and sometimes modems. All of this gave me some really valuable lessons that proved to be essential throughout my work life. What happened to the demo scene and the team? Well, we are still doing things together, on Commodore 64, Amiga and other retro platforms, going to demo parties and competing with other teams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWorking with software engineering gives me a perfect mix of creativity and structure.

It gives me a great feeling when I see people helping each other out and learning together. To coach people to learn, explore and push their abilities further is something I want to dive deeper into in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOutside of the office, I enjoy spending as much time as I can with my wife and daughter, meeting friends, and occasionally enjoying a good run.
